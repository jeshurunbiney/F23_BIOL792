    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have used tools that allow pattern recognition as a basis\n",
    "for completing some task or file manipulation in both Unix (e.g.,\n",
    "`grep`, `sed`, `tr`, `awk`) and Python (`str.count()`). However, our use\n",
    "of these tools has largely involved searching for fixed patterns. While\n",
    "working with biological data, and really any other form of big data, we\n",
    "will encounter many problems that will require more flexible match\n",
    "patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start working with regular expressions using the `re` module. As\n",
    "hinted above with `sys`, modules/libraries will play a major role in\n",
    "enabling your python code. We will cover that in more detail in a few\n",
    "weeks, and we will get into more detail on regular expressions next\n",
    "week. First, lets introduce pattern matching for regular expressions\n",
    "using `re` (which stands for regular expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use functionality in the `re` module in your code, you want to add a\n",

    "into `re`, but lets start here with `re.search`, which simply returns a\n",
    "true/false based on whether the match occurs in the string or not. The\n",
    "general idea is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    re.search(pattern, string)\n",

    "    if re.search(\"TAG\", Seq):\n",

    "        print(\"Seq begins with A.\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    Seq = \"ATCGGGGCCTAGAAT\"\n",
